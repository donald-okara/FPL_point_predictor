## Introduction
Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a popular online fantasy football game where participants create virtual teams comprising real Premier League players. These virtual teams earn points based on the real players' performances in actual Premier League matches. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for data analysis of FPL data, aiding FPL enthusiasts in making informed decisions regarding team selection and strategy.

## Data Sources
To perform in-depth FPL data analysis, we rely on the official FPL API as the primary data source. The following are key data sources used in this project:

- [Fantasy Premier League API](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/): This API serves as the principal data source, offering a wide array of data, including player information, team details, fixtures, and more.

## Getting Started
Before diving into FPL data analysis, it is imperative to ensure that you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. To initiate the project, you will need Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- requests

You can readily install these libraries using pip. Here's an example of how to install them:

```shell
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib requests
```

## Data Preparation
Data preparation is a critical step before engaging in data analysis. This involves fetching relevant data from the FPL API, cleansing it, and structuring it into DataFrames. Here are the detailed steps for data preparation:

### 1. Teams Filtering
- Retrieve data from the FPL API and convert it into structured DataFrames.
- Append event IDs to the teams' data for all 38 game weeks.
- Merge fixture data with teams' data to form a comprehensive dataset.

### 2. Player Filtering
- Retrieve player data from the FPL API.
- Merge player data with fixture data, creating a comprehensive dataset that encompasses player information and performance.

Data preparation ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and provides a foundation for subsequent analytical steps.

## Data Analysis
Once the data is meticulously prepared, a wide range of analyses can be conducted to glean insights from FPL data. Some of the analyses that can be carried out encompass:

- Player performance analysis, examining the performance of individual players over various game weeks.
- Team performance analysis, evaluating the performance of FPL teams and their key players.
- Fixture analysis, assessing the difficulty of upcoming fixtures for FPL teams.
- Market value analysis, exploring how player market values change over time.
- Points distribution analysis, understanding how points are distributed among players.

These analyses aim to equip FPL enthusiasts with valuable insights that can inform their team selection and overall strategy.
